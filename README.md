# python-DataTypes
Some of the datatypes are
1) NONE:If we have a variable and that it is not assigned with any value and it is none.
2) NUMERIC:
       ->Int
       ->Float
       ->Complex
              ex:-6+9j (j=root(-1))
       ->Boolean

**PYTHON-OPERATORS**
 Types of operators are
1)Arithmetic Operator:  +,-,*,/,%, * *,//
    ex:-9+3=12,"de"+"ck"=deck,4-3=1
2)Assignment Operator: =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,* *=,//==
    ex:->>>x=3
        >>>x+=6
        9
        >>>x-=8
        1
3)Comparision/Relational Operator: ==,!=,>,>=,<,<=
    ex:->>>x=3
        >>>y=3
        >>>z=5
        >>>x==y
        True
        >>>x==5
        False
4)Logical Operator: And,Or,Not
    ex:->>>3>2 and 4>2
        True
        >>>3>2 and 4>5
        False
5)Identity Operator: is,is not
     ex:->>>x=3
         >>>y=3
         >>>x is y
         True
         >>>z=5
         >>>x is not z
         True
6)Membership Operators: in,not in  (these are unique in python because they required in looping conditions)
      ex:->>>x=[1,2,3,4]
          >>>1 in x
          True
          >>>5 not in x
          False
